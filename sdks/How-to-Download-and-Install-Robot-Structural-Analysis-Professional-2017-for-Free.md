Robot Structural Analysis Professional 2017 is a powerful and versatile software that can help you design and analyze complex structures with ease and accuracy. By downloading and installing the trial version, you can experience its capabilities for free and decide if it meets your needs and expectations.

Some of the features that make Robot Structural Analysis Professional 2017 a powerful and versatile software are:

- BIM-integrated workflows: You can exchange data with Revit and other design tools, such as AutoCAD and Advance Steel, to create a seamless and collaborative BIM process. You can import and export models, results, and drawings, as well as synchronize changes and updates between applications. This can help you to improve accuracy, efficiency, and coordination of your structural design[^1^].
- Wind load simulation: You can test wind loads during design to avoid costly changes and ensure the safety and stability of your structures. You can use various wind load generators, such as ASCE 7-10, EN 1991-1-4, and NBCC 2015, to apply wind loads on your models. You can also simulate wind tunnel tests and generate wind load reports[^1^].
- Extensive analysis capabilities: You can test the behavior of static, modal, and nonlinear structures using a range of analysis methods and solvers. You can perform linear and nonlinear static analysis, modal analysis, response spectrum analysis, time history analysis, buckling analysis, pushover analysis, footfall analysis, and more. You can also use advanced materials and elements, such as cables, dampers, isolators, and links[^1^].
- Finite element auto-meshing: You can create a high-quality, advanced finite element mesh for more precise analysis results. You can use various meshing options, such as automatic meshing, manual meshing, local mesh refinement, adaptive mesh refinement, and mesh quality control. You can also use different types of elements, such as beams, shells, solids, plates, bars, springs, and masses[^1^].
- Country-specific design standards: You can work with country-specific section shapes and building codes in imperial or metric systems to support code checking. You can use more than 40 international codes for steel and concrete design, such as AISC 360-10/16, ACI 318-14/19, Eurocode 2/3/8/9/4/5/6/7/1-4/1-6/1-9/1-10/1-11/1-12/2-4/3-2/4-2/5-2/6-2/7-2/8-2/9-2/10-2/11-2/12-2/13-2/14-2/15-2/16-2/17-2/18-2/19-2/20-2 (EN 1990 to EN 1999), BS 5950:2000 (UK), CSA S16:09 (Canada), IS 456:2000 (India), GB 50010:2010 (China), AS 4100:1998 (Australia), NZS 3404:1997 (New Zealand), NTC RCDF 2004 (Mexico), NBR 6118:2014 (Brazil), NSR 10 (Colombia), SANS 10162:2011 (South Africa), SP 63.13330.2012 (Russia), TS EN 1993 (Turkey), HKCOP 2013 (Hong Kong), SS EN 1993 (Singapore), KBC 2009 (Korea), AIJ ASDM/AIJ LRFD (Japan), TCVN 5574:2018 (Vietnam), SNI 1729:2015/SNI 2847:2013/SNI 1726:2019/SNI 1727:2019 (Indonesia) [^1^].
- Open and flexible API: You can create custom parametric structures, directly extract results, and extend analysis and code-checking capabilities using the open and flexible application programming interface (API). You can use various programming languages, such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), C#, C++, or Python. You can also access online documentation and samples to help you get started with the API[^1^] [^3^].

These are some of the features that make Robot Structural Analysis Professional 2017 a software that can help you design and analyze complex structures with ease and accuracy.
